# About Algotress

Algotress is a fortress of classic computer science algorithms implemented in JavaScript.

The cool thing about Algotress is that I try to break down difficult concepts into concepts easier to understand.

The code for Algotress is tastefully commented and tries to go the extra mile.

I think this wil be an invaluable resource for persons without a Computer Science background as I currently possess none.

# Installation

Simply clone this project and run `npm install`. Webpack is used for module bundling to keep algorithms reusable.
